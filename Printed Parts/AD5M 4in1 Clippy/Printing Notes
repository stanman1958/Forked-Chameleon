I printed my parts in PETG

The main part (AD5M Clippy for 4in1.stl) I printed upright, with supports.  I had printed earlier versions upsidedown but I wanted to preserve 
the clean printing of the area where the 4in1 and the sleeve fit as the intent are for these to be alighned but able to slide up and down.
The skinny rubberband is tied off at the 2 loops that are there to hold the sleeve and the 4in1 in place.  
This functions as a small buffer when loading filament from the Forked Chameleons to the AD5M toolhead.

I printed the FF_AD5m 3d Chameleon Auto Clippy Blade.stl at 98.5% scaling - at 100% the part was a little snug when I tried it.  
It needs to be free and not binding in operation.

The 2 clips on the back of the Clippy snapped off when I was sliding the assembly on to the toolhead.  That is why I
used the medium rubberband to insure the Clippy stays in place.  It is working well and makes for easy removal if needed.
